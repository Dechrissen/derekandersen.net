                    I am a graduate student studying Computational Linguistics at Stony Brook University. I'm interested in programming, linguistics, web design, and typography. I also enjoy writing and I
                    maintain <a href="/blog.html">a blog here on this website.</a>
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    It's my hope that the information on this website is presented in such a way that keeps your attention. That's the goal of a writer, designer, or anyone who's trying to convey information, whether visually or verbally or
                    with written word: to keep your attention. If the information a reader is looking for isn't clearly presented or easy to find, more often than not, they'll forgo the information.

                    This is just my personal website, but I'm still going to make it my goal to keep your attention. Of course the primary goal in writing is to be good at writing. But good typography is like a nice book cover, and it can
                    be the difference between somebody choosing to read your content or clicking away. That being said, I'm glad you made it to the bottom of this paragraph! This introduction ends here, but I have more to say. I hope to see
                    you in the blog section.
