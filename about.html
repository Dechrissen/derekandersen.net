                    I graduated from Stony Brook University with an M.A. in Computational Linguistics in January of 2021. I'm interested in programming, linguistics, web design, and typography. I enjoy writing and I
                    maintain <a href="/blog.html">a blog here on this website.</a> I also like video games.
                </p>

                    It's my hope that the information on this website is presented in such a way that keeps your attention. That's the goal of a writer, designer, or anyone who's trying to convey information, whether visually or verbally or
                    with written word: to keep your attention. Good typography is like a nice book cover, and it can
                    be the difference between somebody choosing to read your content or clicking away.
                    That being said, I'm glad you made it to the bottom of this paragraph.
                    I hope you find some inspiration in my site.
