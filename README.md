# [derekandersen.net](https://derekandersen.net)
 My personal website.

## Layout
The site is organized into four main categories:
- about
- projects
- blog
- other

## JavaScript
The site uses vanilla JavaScript and in some cases jQuery to build certain
parts of each page. All four main pages use `/JavaScript/header.js` and
`/JavaScript/footer.js` to build the header and footer respectively. These
contain general information about me, some social links, a top navigation bar,
and a 'last updated' timestamp.

## Blog
To be added: information about how the blog system works, once I overhaul it.
