# [derekandersen.net](https://derekandersen.net)
My personal website.

## Layout
The site is organized into four main categories:
- about
- projects
- blog
- links

## JavaScript
The site uses vanilla JavaScript and in some cases jQuery to build certain
parts of each page.

All four main pages use `/JavaScript/header.js` and
`/JavaScript/footer.js` to build the header and footer respectively. These
contain general information about me, some social links, a top navigation bar,
and a 'last updated' timestamp.

The site has a dark mode toggle switch in the top left, represented by a sun and
moon. This function is powered by `/JavaScript/color-theme-toggle.js`.

## Site categories

### About
A homepage with a picture of me and a general blurb about my interests.

### Projects
A list of my highlighted projects, a small description for each, and a link to
each.

### Blog
A list of all of my blog entries in reverse chronological order. This page and
all of the blog posts are powered by [my blog engine](https://derekandersen.net/blog/new-blog-engine).

### Links
A list of categorized miscellaneous links.
