									<p class="blog-title">Minimalism</p>
									<p style="text-align: right;">7 September 2020</p>
									<p class="text">Over the past few years, I've developed an interest in minimalism. At first, the term 'minimalism'
										can be a scary thing if you're not quite familiar with it. It has undertones of extremism. It conjures up reactions like
										"Minimalism? Why would you want to inflict that kind of suffering on yourself?" or "Thank you, but I happen to like owning more than one shirt!"
										And before I delved into it, admittedly I had some skepticism and a slight preconcieved aversion to the idea. But the more
										I learned about it, the more I realized that it's so much more than striving to possess as few physical items as possible. In
										fact, that's quite a narrow view of minimalism.<br><br>

										While reducing your possessions, downsizing, and decluttering can undoubtedly have positive effects, it's what comes
										from these practices that has a more transformative effect on the way you live your life. "Reducing" and "downsizing"
										may even be misleading terms. Getting rid of your things just for the sake of it misses the point of minimalism entirely.
										Instead, let's call it 'essentialism': holding onto what actually matters (to you), and what is essential (to your life).
										Reframing it this way helps to paint the picture that minimalism's true purpose is to help you focus on things that matter,
										and to free you from distractions.<br><br>

										Of course, if you have thousands of things, but you feel fulfilled in your life, it may not even make sense for you to make the assessment that you're too
										distracted or that you're focusing on material objects more than you'd like to be. Maybe you get value out of every single thing you own. Maybe
										there's a story behind every item you have, and looking at each one of them fills you with joy. Regardless, it's painfully apparent that too many of us
										are focused on the wrong thingsâ€”a sad truth and a weakness capitalized on by corporations through marketing and advertising.
										I won't go so deep into my thoughts on the causes for this, but it's an important topic for a future blog entry.<br><br>

										Going back to the idea of 'essentialism' as an alternate term, we can also see positive effects of minimalism in areas other than
										"owning stuff." If essentialism is the idea of holding onto what matters to you, then we should also be able to apply this to
										the less tangible aspects of life: things we spend our time doing.
